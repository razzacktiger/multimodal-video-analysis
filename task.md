- [ ] **Frame Analysis**: Leverage Gemini's vision capabilities for frame-specific queries (Day 2)

### Chat-Centric Architecture (Ready for Implementation)
```javascript
// Enhanced chat message structure (planned)
const chatMessage = {
  id: string,
  type: 'user' | 'ai',
  content: string,
  timestamps: [{ time: string, description: string }],
  videoSeekTime: number | null,
  isFrameSearch: boolean,
  frameDescription: string | null
};
```

### Key User Flows (Ready for Day 2)
1. **General Video Query**: "What is this video about?" â†’ AI provides overview with key timestamps
2. **Specific Content Search**: "When does the speaker mention climate change?" â†’ AI finds exact moments with timestamps
3. **Visual Element Search**: "Show me the part with the graph" â†’ AI analyzes frames and provides timestamp with description
4. **Follow-up Questions**: "Tell me more about that section" â†’ AI uses context from previous timestamp

### Success Criteria for MVP
- [x] Clean, modular codebase with proper separation of concerns
- [x] Working video embedding with URL validation
